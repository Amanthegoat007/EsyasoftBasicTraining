The notebook starts by loading the Student_Performance.csv dataset into a pandas DataFrame. Basic information about the dataset, such as data types and the presence of null values, is checked. The number of duplicate rows is also identified.

 ## Data Cleaning
Duplicate rows are removed and NULL values are removed. Columns_renaming for better understanding.

## Data Visualization
Used Heatmap for that.

## Model Prediction
A linear regression model is built to predict the student's performance index based on their previous scores.
