The notebook starts by loading the Candy_Performance.csv dataset into a pandas DataFrame. Basic information about the dataset, such as data types and the presence of null values, is checked. The number of duplicate rows is also identified.

 ## Data Cleaning

## Data Visualization
Used Confusion_matrix for that.

## Model Prediction
A Logistic regression model is built to predict the Candy's performance index based on their Categorical data.
