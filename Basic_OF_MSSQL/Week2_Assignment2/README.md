# Week 2 SQL Assignment

## Overview

This assignment demonstrates basic SQL operations using a sample database with three tables: `userw`, `books`, and `orders`. The queries cover table creation, data insertion, and solutions to common SQL tasks.

## Database Structure

- **Database:** `Users`
- **Tables:**
  - `userw`: Stores user information (`user_id`, `email`, `name`)
  - `books`: Stores book details (`product_id`, `title`, `price`)
  - `orders`: Stores order records (`order_no`, `user_id`, `product_id`)

## Tasks Covered

1. **Find the top 2 most expensive books purchased by each user.**  
   Joins all tables to display complete order information and rank them.
2. **Find how much each user spent int total and rank them**  
   Displays all records with rank of highest users spent on the books buy.


## How to Use

1. Run the SQL file in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio or any compatible SQL environment.
2. The script will create the database and tables, insert sample data, and execute the queries for each task.
